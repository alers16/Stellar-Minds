# Stellar-Minds üöÄüß†

> A NASA Space Apps ecosystem that combines an intelligent backend based on GraphRAG with an immersive frontend (nasa-space-biology) to discover, converse with, and act on knowledge in space biology.

## üì° What is Stellar-Minds
Stellar-Minds was born as a response to a recurring challenge in the scientific community: extracting meaning from decades of dispersed space biology experiments in NASA‚Äôs Open Science Data Repository (OSDR). Our project creates a cognitive platform that acts as a scientific copilot ‚Äî it understands natural language questions, identifies research gaps, generates graph-backed responses, and provides a visual interface showing how findings interconnect.

The technical core lies in api/, a FastAPI backend that orchestrates AI providers, NASA connectors, and a GraphRAG chatbot. The user experience lives in nasa-space-biology/, a Next.js 15 frontend animated with interactive graphics and Radix/Tailwind components that allow navigation through results, chat initiation, and visualization of the knowledge graph.

## üß≠ End-to-End Experience
1. **Visual Exploration**. The nasa-space-biology site displays an animated hero with particles and a graph canvas introducing the universe of concepts (microgravity, radiation, tissues, flight phases).
2. **Guided Discovery**. The ‚ÄúAdvanced Research Capabilities‚Äù module summarizes what the engine offers: LLM-driven insights, graph-based navigation, an integrated database, and real-time analysis.
3. **Conversational Interaction**. The visitor enters /chat, where the ChatInterface component opens a session with the backend, maintains in-memory history, suggests questions, and reflects live latency.
4. **Specialized Search**. Through /assay-finder and future panels, the frontend calls GET /api/v1/assays/search to translate questions like ‚Äúmicrogravity experiments on mice‚Äù into valid OSDR filters.
5. **Gap detection**. The gap finder module exposes missing organism/tissue/condition combinations, helping plan new scientific missions.

Each interaction is backed by consistent JSON responses that serve the frontend, scientific notebooks, or third-party integrations alike.

## üñ•Ô∏è nasa-space-biology: Immersive Frontend
- **Main framework**: Next.js 15 with React 19 and TypeScript (nasa-space-biology/app).
- **Style and UI:**: Tailwind CSS v4, Shadcn UI variations (Radix + tailwind-merge + class-variance-authority), and custom animations (animate-pulse-glow).
- **Key components**:
  - `Hero: generative`: particle canvas scene, corpus statistics, and CTAs to chat and graph.
  - `KnowledgeGraph`: canvas simulation showing dynamic nodes (microgravity, radiation, plant growth) orbiting around ‚ÄúSpace Biology.‚Äù
  - `ChatInterface`: copilot-style chat experience (Dora AI-like) that creates chats on demand, manages errors, and maintains conversations with intelligent scrolling.
  - `SpaceBackground`: animated nebula layer for the chat area (components/space-background.tsx).
- **Data context**: APIContext.tsx centralizes HTTP calls with Axios, supports multiple endpoints (chat, assays, wikis, etc.), and allows backend configuration via NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL.
- **Graph Explorer**: /graph route prepared for integration with react-force-graph, three.js, and 3D GraphRAG community renders.
- **Controlled access**: CTA section highlights access for authorized personnel with buttons to request credentials or contact the team.

> ‚ú® Result: a portal that not only informs but inspires exploration ‚Äî bridging scientists, investors, and mission architects.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend API (FastAPI + GraphRAG)
- **`api/app.py`**: launches the app, configures CORS with the Vercel domain (vercel-app-frontend-tawny.vercel.app), and injects ChatService and OpenAIProvider in the lifespan.
- **Conversational Chat** (`api/graphbot/`):
  - `GraphRAGBot sends queries to run_local_search, run_global_search, or run_drift_search (GraphRAG CLI) and operates in threads (asyncio.to_thread) to avoid blocking the async loop.
  - `ChatService` creates and manages chat histories in MemoryStore (concurrency protected by threading.RLock).
  - Exceptions like ChatBusyError return 409 Conflict, ensuring consistent frontend UX.
- **Assay Finder** (`api/assay_finder/router.py`):
  - `GetFilterPrompt` converts free text into JSON filters (organism, condition, assay/technology regex, dataset).
  - Uses `httpx.AsyncClient` to query OSDR (`visualization.osdr.nasa.gov`).
  - Deduplicates results, calculates `has_flight`/`has_ground flags, and generates HTML dataset links.
- **Gap Finder** (`api/gap_finder/router.py`):
  - Normalizes tissues, conditions, and data presence to identify untested experimental areas.
  - Returns unique lists to populate UI components (selectors and advanced filters).
- **AI Provider** (`api/ai/providers/openai_provider.py`):
  - Wraps calls to `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`, and `gpt-4o` with custom formatters (`OpenAIFormatter`).
  - Exposes `get_active_models` for dynamic UI rendering in the frontend.

## üîÑ Intelligence Flow
1. User launches a query from the web or REST API.
2. FastAPI creates context with OpenAI keys (OPENAI_API_KEY) and GraphRAG path (APP_BACK_GRAPHRAG_ROOT).
3. Specialized prompts (`GetFilterPrompt`, `GetGapFilterPrompt`) produce reproducible filters.
4. GraphRAG or NASA APIs provide raw content.
5. Data is enriched (conditions, links, flight flags) and returned to the frontend.
6. The frontend renders chat, cards, charts, or 3D visualizations as needed.

## üí° Innovation that Adds Value
- **Semantic‚ÜíStructured translation** üß¨: researchers write as they speak; the system responds with precise filters ready for scientific pipelines.
- **Graph + narrative** üåê: GraphRAG builds narratives supported by knowledge graphs, enabling citation of contexts and relationships.
- **Visual-first** üé®: nasa-space-biology uses animated canvases, live data, and interactive graphs to keep the audience immersed.
- **Hybrid orchestration** ü§ù: combines NASA public APIs, proprietary infrastructure, and external AI services with an extensible design (future open-source LLMs, persistent databases, additional dashboards).
- **Gap discovery** üï≥Ô∏è: the gap finder prioritizes missions by showing which (organism, tissue, condition) combinations remain unexplored.

## üß™  Detailed Use Cases
- **Experiment planning**: select sequencing technologies with flight history and comparable conditions for new ISS missions.
- **Rapid literature review**: GraphRAG chat summarizes findings and links to related datasets without leaving the browser.
- **Coverage auditing**: gap finder reflects missing ground-control data, guiding agencies and universities.
- **Scientific onboarding**: new researchers explore the graph, read cards, and receive conversational guides in English or Spanish.
- **Executive presentations**: stylized UI communicates value to non-technical stakeholders with clear metrics and visuals.
